      responsibilities3: "Make sure any waste is safely handled and stored"
      responsibilities4: "Minimise the environmental impact of waste by prioritising waste prevention, re-use, recycling and recovery over disposal. This is known as applying the 'waste hierarchy'"

      responsibilities3: "Make sure any waste is safely handled and stored"
