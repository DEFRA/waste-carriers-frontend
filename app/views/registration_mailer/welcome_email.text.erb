Lower tier registration
-----------------------
You are registered as a lower tier waste carrier/broker/dealer under The Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 because you have declared that you meet one of the following criteria:

- You only transport your own business waste, unless it is construction or demolition waste
- You are a charity or voluntary organisation
- You are a waste collection authority, a waste disposal authority or a waste regulation authority
- You only handle animal by-products, waste from a mine or quarry or waste from premises used for agriculture

Legal responsibilities for waste
-------------------------------------
If you produce, carry, import, keep, treat or dispose of waste, or manage it for other people, you have a legal 'duty of care' for that waste. The duty of care aims to protect the environment and human health. There are some simple rules you must follow:

- If you give your waste to another person or business you must check they are properly authorised to accept it, e.g. as a permitted site or a registered waste carrier
- Make sure the correct documentation is completed for each transfer of waste and that it correctly describes the waste
- Make sure any waste is safely handled and stored
- Minimise the environmental impact of waste by prioritising waste prevention, re-use, recycling and recovery over disposal. This is known as applying the 'waste hierarchy'
