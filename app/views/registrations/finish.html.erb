<h3>Your legal responsibilities for waste</h3>
<p>If you produce, carry, import, keep, treat or dispose of waste you have a legal 'duty of care' for that waste. The duty of care aims to protect the environment and human health by making sure that waste is handled safely and only passed to people authorised to receive it. There are some simple rules you must follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give your waste to another business check the person properly authorised to accept it. For example, they are a permitted site or a registered waste carrier</li>
<li>Make sure any waste is safely contained and is not able to escape control.</li>
<li>Make sure the correct documentation is completed for each transfer of waste and that it correctly describes the waste</li>
<li>Minimise the environmental impact of waste by prioritising waste prevention, re-use, recycling and recovery over disposal. This is known as applying the 'waste hierarchy'</li>
<ul>
