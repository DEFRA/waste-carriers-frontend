Feature: Validation of registrations

As the service owner
I want to ensure that registration data is validated
So that only valid registrations can be made and incomplete registrations are avoided

The registration form has the following fields to be entered by the user:
* Business or organisation type (dropdown select)
* Business, organisation or trading name
* Address:
  * Building name or number
  * Street (line 1)
  * Street (line 2)
  * Town or city
  * Postcode
* Contact Information:
  * Title (dropdown select)
  * First name
  * Last name
  * Job title
  * Phone number
  * Email address
* Declaration checkbox
* Email (for user account)
* password
* password confirmation
