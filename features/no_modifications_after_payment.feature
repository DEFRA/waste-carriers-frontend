Feature: no modifications to upper tier registrations or during payment

After the registration has been paid, or while the user is paying,
it should not be possible to modify the registration by going back 
in the browser history, or requesting a page directly.

...in fact the registration should not be editable after it has been saved (after account signup/creation)
